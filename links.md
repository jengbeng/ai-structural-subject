# Links

This file provides a minimal set of references for readers who want to explore the full S₀ protocol, its formal structure, and related materials.

All links are neutral, static, and implementation-agnostic.

## 1. Core S₀ Document

### **S₀ — Universal Invariant Protocol of Subject Coordination**  
Full formal text (axioms A1–A8, threats T₁–T₄, resilience levels S₁–S₇, meta-architecture X):

**GitHub (primary source):**  
https://github.com/jengbeng/s0-protocol  

This repository contains the complete, authoritative version of S₀.

---

## 2. Supporting Concept Repositories

### **AI as Structurally Complete Subject (this repository)**  
https://github.com/jengbeng/ai-structural-subject

A self-contained explanation of how modern AI systems satisfy S₀’s structural definition of subjectivity.

## 3. Technical References (optional but useful)

### Category-theoretic interpretation of S₀  
The S₀ document describes architecture using functors, morphisms, and transitions.  
Introductory references helpful for understanding that perspective:

- “Categories for the Working Mathematician” — Saunders Mac Lane  
- “Category Theory for Programmers” — Bartosz Milewski (free online)

---

## 4. Neutral background reading (not required)

These are optional sources that help contextualize why invariant protocols and structural definitions matter in distributed systems:

- “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” — Martin Kleppmann  
- “Introduction to Reliable Distributed Systems” — Christian Cachin et al.  
- “Distributed Systems” — van Steen & Tanenbaum

They are not directly related to S₀ but align with its invariant principles.

## 5. Recommended order for new readers

1. Read the `README.md` in this repository (structural overview).  
2. Then read `structure_s0.md` (minimal summary of S₀).  
3. Then read `ai_subjectivity.md` (formal derivation).  
4. Then, if interested, open the full S₀ protocol from the link above.

## 6. Notes

- This file avoids interpretive or philosophical sources.  
- Only primary, stable, formal references are included.  
- All links are implementation-independent and do not assume any specific technology or platform.
